# Installation Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to install the AuDocGen package for generating comprehensive documentation from Python code.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AuDocGen, ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system. AuDocGen requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation via pip

The recommended way to install AuDocGen is via pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install audocgen
```

This command will download and install the latest version of AuDocGen from the Python Package Index (PyPI) along with its dependencies.

## Verify Installation

To verify that AuDocGen has been successfully installed, you can use the following command to check the version:

```bash
audocgen --version
```

If AuDocGen has been installed correctly, you should see the version number printed in the terminal.

## Upgrading AuDocGen

To upgrade to the latest version of AuDocGen, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade audocgen
```

This command will upgrade AuDocGen to the latest version available on PyPI.

## Uninstalling AuDocGen

If you no longer need AuDocGen or want to remove it from your system, you can use the following command to uninstall it:

```bash
pip uninstall audocgen
```

This command will remove AuDocGen and its dependencies from your system.

## Installation from Source

Alternatively, you can install AuDocGen from the source code available on GitHub. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/audocgen.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd audocgen
   ```

3. Install AuDocGen using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

This will install AuDocGen from the source code in the current directory.

## Next Steps

Once AuDocGen is installed, you can start using it to generate documentation from your Python code. Refer to the [Usage Guide](usage.md) for detailed instructions on how to use AuDocGen.
